/// to find the kind that concerns them. That breaks quietly: several changes land separately, each
/// adds the heading it needs without looking at what is already there, and the block ends up
/// splitting one kind across two places. Nothing else notices. The compiler has no opinion about a
/// markdown heading, and the parity gates in this folder all read documents against the code — the

/// <c>Changed</c> sections.

/// in those blocks stay there.
